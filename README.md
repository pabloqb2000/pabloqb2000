## Hi there 👋
I'm Pablo, nice to meet you! Here's something about me.

📖 I love using technology to make a difference! I have a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from UAM University. Right now, I'm diving deeper into my passion by doing a Master's in Machine Learning for Health at UC3M, where I'm excited to work on AI solutions that can improve healthcare.

🌍 Since 2021, I've been volunteering with different NGOs, focusing on education and support for underprivileged children. At the moment, I’m leading a project in Cañada Real, Madrid, where we provide care and educational assistance to children with special needs.

🔭 In my spare time, I'm working on a math teaching app. Can't wait to share more about it soon!

✏️ Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate on something cool!
